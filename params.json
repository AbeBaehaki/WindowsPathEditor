{"name":"Windows Path Editor","tagline":"The non-frustrating way to editor your PATH on Windows","body":"Windows Path Editor\r\n===================\r\n\r\nThis tool helps you manage your PATH on Windows.\r\n\r\nIn a fit of horrible irony, on Windows you'll have the most need to edit your\r\nPATH, since all applications insist on creating their own `bin` directories\r\ninstead of installing to a global `bin` directory like on Unices, and you have\r\nthe worst built-in tools to deal with this. The default environment editor\r\ndialog where you get to see 30 characters at once if you're lucky? Yuck.\r\n\r\n*Windows Path Editor* (a horribly creative name, I know) gives you a\r\nbetter overview and easier ways to manipulate your path settings.\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n\r\n- Edit your path using drag and drop.\r\n- Detect conflicts between directories on your path (diagnose issues like the\r\n  wrong executable being launched or the wrong DLL being loaded).\r\n- Remove bogus entries from your path with a single click.\r\n- Scan your disk for tools that have a `bin` directory and automatically add\r\n  them to your path.\r\n- UAC aware.\r\n\r\n[Download Here](rix0r.nl/downloads/windowspatheditor/windowspatheditor-1.0.zip)\r\n\r\n![Screen Shot of Windows Path Editor](https://raw.github.com/rix0rrr/WindowsPathEditor/master/screenshot.png)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
